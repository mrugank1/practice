  <h1>THE NEEDLE TREE</h1>

  <p>Once,there were two brothers who lived at the forest’s edge.The oldest brother was always unkind to his younger brother. The older brother took all the food and snatched all the good clothes.

    The oldest brother used to go into the forest in search of firewood to sell in the market.As he walked through the forest, he chopped off the branches of every tree, until he came upon a magical tree.
    
    The tree stopped him before he chopped its branches and said,<q>Oh!Sir, please spare my branches.If you spare me, I will provide you with golden apples.</q>
    
    The oldest brother agreed but was feeling disappointed with how many apples the tree gave him.

  <br> Overcome by greed,the brother threatened to cut the entire tree if it didn’t provide him with more apples.But, instead of giving more apples,the tree showered him with hundreds of tiny needles.The brother fell to the ground, crying in pain as the sun began to set.
    
    Soon,the younger brother became worried and went to search for his older brother.He searched until he found him at the trunk of the tree, lying in pain with hundreds of needles on his body.
    
    He rushed to him and started to painstakingly remove each needle with love. Once the needles were out,the oldest brother apologized for treating his younger brother so badly.The magical tree saw the change in the older brother’s heart and gifted them with all the golden apples,they could need.<b>IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE KIND AND PATIENT,AS IT WILL ALWAYS BE REWARDED.</br></b></p>
